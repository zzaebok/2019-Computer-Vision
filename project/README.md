# Fake / Real Image Classification Model

### Objective ###
Classify whether the given input image is real or fake

### Data Features and Preprocess ###
- Fake images are generated by GAN or Photoshop
- samples

- Upsampling real images through Large-scale CelebFaces [http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html]
- Upsampling fake images through simple resampling
- Image augmentation (rotation, flip, color jitter etc..)

### Model ###
- KFold cross validation
  - on Resnet, Densenet, and Ensemble model (resnet + densenet)
  - Ensemble model got highest validation score
- Ensemble model structure

- Learning rate: 0.00025, Batch size: 32, Optimizer: Adam, Used learning rate scheduler

### Result ###
- samples
